Analysis of Air Pollution Dataset and Machine Learning Challenge

Introduction
In this report, we will analyze a dataset that provides measurements of air pollutants (PM1, PM2, and CO2) with and without the presence of a certain parameter (GW). The dataset covers a period from November 23, 2018, to February 20, 2019. The goal is to understand the impact of the parameter on pollution levels and explore potential machine learning approaches to predict pollutant levels.



Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
Date: The date of the measurements.
PM1 With GW: PM1 measurements with the presence of GW.
PM1 Without GW: PM1 measurements without the presence of GW.
PM2 With GW: PM2 measurements with GW.
PM2 Without GW: PM2 measurements without GW.
CO2_With GW: CO2 measurements with GW.
CO2_Without GW: CO2 measurements without GW.
The dataset enables a comparison between pollutant levels with and without the presence of GW. This comparison will provide insights into the impact of GW on pollution levels.

Machine Learning Challenge
The machine learning challenge in this analysis is to develop a model that can predict pollutant levels based on the given features. The challenge can be approached as a regression problem, where we aim to predict the numerical values of pollutant levels (PM1, PM2, and CO2) based on the presence or absence of GW.

Data Exploration
Visualize the distribution of pollutant measurements (with and without GW) using histograms or box plots.
Calculate summary statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and correlation coefficients, to gain insights into the dataset.

Data Preprocessing
Checking  missing values and handling them accordingly (e.g., imputation or removal).
Performing any necessary data transformations (e.g., normalization or scaling) to prepare the data for modeling.

Feature Selection/Engineering
Assessing the importance of features using techniques like correlation analysis.
Consider additional feature engineering steps to create new meaningful features that may improve model performance.

Model Selection
Evaluate various regression models, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector regression, and neural networks.
Comparing the performance of different models based on evaluation metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.

Model Training and Evaluation
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training the selected models using the training data.
Evaluateing the models' performance using appropriate metrics on the testing data.
Selecting the best-performing model based on the evaluation results.

Model Fine-tuning and Optimization
Performing hyperparameter tuning for the selected model to optimize its performance.
Considering techniques like cross-validation or grid search to find the best hyperparameters.
